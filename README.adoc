This is a simple example of how to use documentation as code.

== Technologies involved

* https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] as format to write the software architecture documentation
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor] to generate the representations of the software architecture documentation written in AsciiDoc

== Prerequisites

* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/[Asciidoctor]
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/install/[Asciidoctor-PDF]

== Generate the software architecture documentation representations

=== Generate the documentation as HTML representation

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 index.adoc
----

=== Generate the documentation as PDF representation

[source,bash]
----
asciidoctor -b pdf -r asciidoctor-pdf index.adoc
